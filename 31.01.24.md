### Please find pizzerias that have been visited more often by women or by men. For any SQL operators with sets save duplicates (UNION ALL, EXCEPT ALL, INTERSECT ALL constructions). Please sort a result by the pizzeria name. The data sample is provided below.
```
SELECT p.name AS pizzeria_name, COUNT(*) AS total_visits
FROM person_visits pv
JOIN pizzeria p ON pv.pizzeria_id = p.id

WHERE pe.gender = 'female'
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY p.name;

## Task 04
### Please find a union of pizzerias that have orders either from women or from men. Other words, you should find a set of pizzerias names have been ordered by females only and make "UNION" operation with set of pizzerias names have been ordered by males only. Please be aware with word “only” for both genders. For any SQL operators with sets don’t save duplicates (UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT). Please sort a result by the pizzeria name. The data sample is provided below.
```
SELECT name FROM pizzeria
WHERE id IN (
SELECT pizzeria_id FROM person_visits
JOIN person ON person.id = person_visits.person_id
WHERE gender = 'female'
)
UNION
SELECT name FROM pizzeria
WHERE id IN (
SELECT pizzeria_id FROM person_visits
JOIN person ON person.id = person_visits.person_id
WHERE gender = 'male'
)
ORDER BY name;
```

FROM menu m1
JOIN menu m2 ON m1.pizza_name = m2.pizza_name AND m1.price = m2.price AND m1.pizzeria_id <> m2.pizzeria_id
JOIN pizzeria p1 ON m1.pizzeria_id = p1.id
JOIN pizzeria p2 ON m2.pizzeria_id = p2.id

### Please register a new pizza with name “greek pizza” (use id = 19) with price 800 rubles in “Dominos” restaurant (pizzeria_id = 2). Warning: this exercise will probably be the cause of changing data in the wrong way. Actually, you can restore the initial database model with data from the link in the “Rules of the day” section.
```
INSERT INTO menu (id, pizza_name, price, pizzeria_id)
VALUES (19, 'greek pizza', 800, 2);

Actually, you can restore the initial database model with data from the link in the “Rules of the day” section and replay script from Exercise 07.
```
INSERT INTO menu (id, pizza_name, price, pizzeria_id)
VALUES ((SELECT MAX(id) FROM menu) + 1, 'sicilian pizza', 900, (SELECT id FROM pizzeria WHERE name = 'Dominos'));
